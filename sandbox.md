# Getting an SFCC Sandbox

### For Customers and Partners

There are three main ways to get sandboxes for Salesforce B2C Commerce:
* For customers and prospects: Please reach out to your Commerce Cloud Account Executive
* For System Integrator (SI) partners: reach out to your Partner Manager, or see details [here](https://partners.salesforce.com/pdx/s/learn/article/b2c-commerce-MCDSZA63SNTNCRRBPDZX3PU7OGWI?language=en_US) about becoming a Salesforce Partner where you can get your own sandboxes
* For ISVs and ISV prospects: You can complete [this form](https://1.appexchange.com/LINK-contact-us) if you are looking to be an ISV Partner where you can get a trial sandbox

### For Other Uses

For open source projects, reach out to [@Peter Schmalfeldt](https://sfcc-unofficial.slack.com/team/UFNCER2AK) in the SFCC Unofficial Slack.

For any other reason for a sandbox, reach out to [@Andrew Lawrence](https://sfcc-unofficial.slack.com/team/UMN1ZJME3) in the SFCC Unofficial Slack. There are no promises for other use cases -- it will depend on what you are looking to use it for, who you are working for, length of time you need it, etc.
