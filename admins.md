# Admins of SFCC Unofficial Slack Community

All admins of this community are fulfilling that duty in a volunteer capacity. Please keep that in mind when they reach out to you or you reach out to them.

## Admin Duties

1. Moderate the Slack workspace, making sure members adhere to our guidelines
2. Process new user sign-ups regularly
3. Participate in admin requests, discussions, decisions, and our partnership with Salesforce
4. Contribute to our guidelines
5. Vote on new admin nominees
6. Represent the Unofficial SFCC brand in a positive way across the ecosystem
7. Give lots of ðŸŒ®s

## Admins Guiding Principles

We aim for an approximate ratio of 1 admin : 100 members.

Our admins should be:
* active in the SFCC ecosystem
* active and positive contributors in the Unofficial SFCC workspace
* trusted ambassadors for the Unofficial SFCC brand
* representative of our community in terms of demograhics, geolocation, and technology (B2C / B2B / OMS etc.)

## How to Become an Admin

Admin will be considered both based on merit and need, referencing the guiding principles above. 

* Members can be nominated or self-nominate in the #admin-requests channel
* Members may also be considered from internal nomination within the curent admins group
* Approval takes place among admins via a closed vote. A nominee needs at least 50% "Yes" votes among current admins to be added with 0 "No" votes. (A "No" vote does not automatically reject the candidate but merits further discussion on a case-by-case basis).
